# Vulnerability Management Decisions

This section will define our audience for decision advice and how we are scoping our advice on vulnerability management decisions.
Viable decision guidance for vulnerability management should (at a minimum) consider the stakeholder groups, their potential decision outcomes, and the data needed for relevant decision points.
This section covers the first of these three parts, and the following sections address the other parts in turn.
The “who” is primarily about categories of stakeholders—suppliers, deployers, and coordinators—as well as their individual risk tolerances.
The “what” is about the scope, both in how the affected system is defined and how much of the world an analyst should consider when estimating effects of a vulnerability.

While we strive to make our examples realistic, we invite the community to engage and conduct empirical assessments to test them.
The following construction should be treated as an informed hypothesis rather than a conclusion.
