## Coordinator Trees

As described in [Decisions During Vulnerability Coordination](#decisions-during-vulnerability-coordination), a coordination stakeholder usually makes separate triage and publication decisions. Each have trees presented below.

This tree is a suggestion in that CERT/CC believes it works for us.
Other coordinators should consider customizing the tree to their needs, as described in [Tree Construction and Customization Guidance](#tree-construction-and-customization-guidance).
