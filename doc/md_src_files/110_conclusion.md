# Conclusion

We presented a working hypothesis for how patch developers and patch appliers should prioritize their effort to mitigate different vulnerabilities. We have performed an initial pilot evaluation of the proposal and improved it, but the process we developed for evaluation is more important than the results. We invite further refinement of the prioritization mechanism. Further testing will be required before SSVC is ready for operational use. We endeavored to be transparent about our process and provide justification for design decisions.

We invite questions, comments, and further community refinement in moving forward with a transparent and justified vulnerability prioritization methodology that is inclusive for the various stakeholders and industries that develop and use information and computer technology.
