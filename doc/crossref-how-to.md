# How To Use Cross References

- Cross references to other sections can be accomplished with the `[text](link)` syntax for links.
  - The text to appear goes in `[]`
  - The heading to link to goes in `()`
- Use full heading text, lowercased, with `-` instead of spaces. 
  - for example [Section 2](#current-state-of-practice)
  - See: https://gist.github.com/asabaylus/3071099

## To create an arbitrary anchor
- use HTML, e.g.:
```html
<a name="anchor-name"></a>
```
