Would most prefer using pandoc-citeproc. Still need to figure out how this would work.
If it will work, prefer converting references to a .bib file for compatibility with latex. 

If pandoc-citeproc won't work, we can define our own method of doing citations using link definitions. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4779582/markdown-and-including-multiple-files
We could define the references as a link, and then that would stay consistent
There could be a separate file of link definitions. 
This file could also have the text references, I suppose. And then at least all the definitions would be in the same place. 
Note link reference definitions can contain a title
https://github.github.com/gfm/#link-reference-definitions
This title will be the HTML mouse-over text, and should contain the full reference data.
In this way, we can eliminate the need for a formal references section.  


It would be nice if footnotes which are a comment and not a reference could use the md footnote syntax 
https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#footnote
But right now GFM doesn't support that. 
Footnotes and asides should be either: written in to the flow of the text OR set off with a **** (horizontal rule) and marked as an aside and ended with another hrule. The second option is not preferred, but can be used for asides that are at least a full paragraph.
