# Each sub-category within the AI-Specific Metrics is scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with the following general interpretation:
#
# 0.0: No Known Vulnerability: Indicates no known vulnerability or a formally proven resistance to the specific threat.
# 0.1 - 0.3: Low Vulnerability: Indicates a low vulnerability with strong mitigation in place, but some minor weaknesses may still exist.
# 0.4 - 0.6: Medium Vulnerability: Indicates a moderate vulnerability with some mitigation, but significant weaknesses remain.
# 0.7 - 1.0: Critical/High Vulnerability: Indicates a severe vulnerability with little to no mitigation in place.
