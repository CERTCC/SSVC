"""
Provides SSVC outcome group objects.

SSVC outcome groups are functionally equivalent to Decision Points.
The only difference is that Outcome Groups are primarily intended to be used
as the outputs of a decision, whereas Decision Points are the inputs to a decision.
However, there are use cases where an outcome of one decision may feed into another
decision, so the distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Hence, we chose to use the same
data structure for both.

Outcome groups are organized by namespace.
