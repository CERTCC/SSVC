# SSVC
Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization Calculator

SSVC Calc is a SSVC calculator app that guides you through the simple steps needed in making
a vulnerability priority decision.  The result of applying SSVC is a priority decision,
providing yuo with a recommended action. See the demo in our [SSVC calc website](https://democert.org/ssvc/)

Some examples of actions are 
defer, scheduled, out-of-band, and immediate.

* To explore the decision tree, use the button "Show Full Tree" This will show all the branches, nodes and edges that make up the decision tree.
* There are also a number of sample CVE in a dropdown that will auto-select a number of steps in the decision tree
* Use the "Start Decision" to navigate the tree for a new vulnerability.
* You can also import custom decision trees and custom CVE samples for the current decision tree.
