- Remove this template and add a description of the changes you are proposing.
- Most pull requests should be in response to an issue, and ideally a PR will
resolve or close one or more issues. 
- If a PR only partially resolves an issue,
we suggest spawning one or more child issues from the main issue to identify what portion
of the issue is resolved by the PR, and what work remains to be done.
- Please use github keywords (closes, fixes, resolves, etc.) to reference relevant issues.
- Using bulleted lists with the issue id at the end lets github automatically
link the issue and provide the title inline.
- CoPilot summaries are welcome in the PR description, but please provide a brief
description of the changes in your own words as well. CoPilot can be good at the _what_,
but not so good at the _why_.
