- Remove this template and add a description of the changes you are proposing.
- Edit the title of the PR to be a concise summary of the changes. The title should
  be descriptive enough to give a reviewer a good idea of what the PR is about, and
  not just a reference to an issue number. PR titles are used in the commit log
  and release notes, so they need to convey meaning on their own.
- Most pull requests should be in response to an issue, and ideally a PR will
  resolve or close one or more issues.
- If a PR only partially resolves an issue,
  we suggest spawning one or more child issues from the main issue to identify what portion
  of the issue is resolved by the PR, and what work remains to be done.
- Please use [github keyword syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests)
  (closes, fixes, resolves, etc.) to reference relevant issues.
- Using bulleted lists with the issue id at the end lets github automatically
  link the issue and provide the title inline. E.g.: `- resolves #99999`
- CoPilot summaries are welcome in the PR description, but please provide a brief
description of the changes in your own words as well. CoPilot can be good at the *what*,
but not so good at the *why*.
