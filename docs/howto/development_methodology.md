## Development Methodology

For this tabletop refinement, we could not select a mathematically representative set of CVEs. 
The goal was to select a handful of CVEs that would cover diverse types of vulnerabilities. 
The CVEs that we used for our tabletop exercises are CVE-2017-8083, CVE-2019-2712, CVE-2014-5570, and CVE-2017-5753.
We discussed each one from the perspective of supplier and deployer. 
We evaluated CVE-2017-8083 twice because our understanding and descriptions had changed materially after the first three CVEs (six evaluation exercises).
After we were satisfied that the decision trees were clearly defined and captured our intentions, we began the formal evaluation of the draft trees, which we describe in the next section.
