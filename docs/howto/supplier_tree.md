# Supplier Tree

The example supplier tree [PDF](../pdf/ssvc_2_supplier.pdf) shows the proposed prioritization decision tree for the supplier. Both supplier and deployer trees use the above decision point definitions. Each tree is a compact way of expressing assertions or hypotheses about the relative priority of different situations. Each tree organizes how we propose a stakeholder should treat these situations. Rectangles are decision points, and triangles represent outcomes. The values for each decision point are different, as described above. Outcomes are priority decisions (defer, scheduled, out-of-cycle, immediate); outcome triangles are color coded:

  - Defer = gray with green outline
  - Scheduled = yellow
  - Out-of-Cycle = orange
  - Immediate = red with black outline
