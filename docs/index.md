# Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization

SSVC stands for A Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization. 
It is a methodology for prioritizing vulnerabilities based on the needs of the stakeholders involved in the vulnerability management process.
SSVC is designed to be used by any stakeholder in the vulnerability management process, including finders, vendors, coordinators, deployers, and others.
