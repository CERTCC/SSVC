# Public Safety Impact

!!! note "Public Safety Impact"

    |   Value     | Definition |
    | :--- | :--------- |
    | Minimal     | [Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md) of None or Minor                     |
    | Significant | [Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md) of Major, Hazardous, or Catastrophic |

{== TODO note that this is a compound decision point, therefore it is a notational convenience ==}

Suppliers necessarily have a rather coarse-grained perspective on the broadly defined [Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md) Decision Point.
Therefore we simplify the above into a binary categorization:

- _Significant_ is when any impact meets the criteria for an impact of Major, Hazardous, or Catastrophic in the
  [Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md) table.
- _Minimal_ is when none do.
