!!! note "Public Value Added v1.0.0"

    === "Text" 
    
        How much value would a publication from the coordinator benefit the broader community?

        | Value | Definition |
        |:-----|:-----------|
        | Precedence | The publication would be the first publicly available, or be coincident with the first publicly available. |
        | Ampliative | Amplifies and/or augments the existing public information about the vulnerability, for example, adds additional detail, addresses or corrects errors in other public information, draws further attention to the vulnerability, etc. |
        | Limited | Minimal value added to the existing public information because existing information is already high quality and in multiple outlets. |
