    The concentration of value in the target

    | Value | Definition |
    |:-----|:-----------|
    | Diffuse | The system that contains the vulnerable component has limited resources. That is, the resources that the adversary will gain control over with a single exploitation event are relatively small. |
    | Concentrated | The system that contains the vulnerable component is rich in resources. Heuristically, such systems are often the direct responsibility of “system operators” rather than users. |
