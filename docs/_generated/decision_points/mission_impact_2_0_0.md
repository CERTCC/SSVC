        | Value | Definition |

        | Degraded | Little to no impact up to degradation of non-essential functions; chronic degradation would eventually harm essential functions |
        | MEF Support Crippled | Activities that directly support essential functions are crippled; essential functions continue for a time |
        | MEF Failure | Any one mission essential function fails for period of time longer than acceptable; overall mission of the organization degraded but can still be accomplished for a time |
        | Mission Failure | Multiple or all mission essential functions fail; ability to recover those functions degraded; organizationâ€™s ability to deliver its overall mission fails |
