        The safety impact of the vulnerability.

        | Value | Definition |
        |:-----|:-----------|
        | None | The effect is below the threshold for all aspects described in Minor. |
        | Minor | Any one or more of these conditions hold. Physical harm: Physical discomfort for users (not operators) of the system. Operator resiliency: Requires action by system operator to maintain safe system state as a result of exploitation of the vulnerability where operator actions would be well within expected operator abilities; OR causes a minor occupational safety hazard. System resiliency: Small reduction in built-in system safety margins; OR small reduction in system functional capabilities that support safe operation. Environment: Minor externalities (property damage, environmental damage, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial Financial losses, which are not readily absorbable, to multiple persons. Psychological: Emotional or psychological harm, sufficient to be cause for counselling or therapy, to multiple persons. |
        | Major | Any one or more of these conditions hold. Physical harm: Physical distress and injuries for users (not operators) of the system. Operator resiliency: Requires action by system operator to maintain safe system state as a result of exploitation of the vulnerability where operator actions would be within their capabilities but the actions require their full attention and effort; OR significant distraction or discomfort to operators; OR causes significant occupational safety hazard. System resiliency: System safety margin effectively eliminated but no actual harm; OR failure of system functional capabilities that support safe operation. Environment: Major externalities (property damage, environmental damage, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial: Financial losses that likely lead to bankruptcy of multiple persons. Psychological: Widespread emotional or psychological harm, sufficient to be cause for counselling or therapy, to populations of people. |
        | Hazardous | Any one or more of these conditions hold. Physical harm: Serious or fatal injuries, where fatalities are plausibly preventable via emergency services or other measures. Operator resiliency: Actions that would keep the system in a safe state are beyond system operator capabilities, resulting in adverse conditions; OR great physical distress to system operators such that they cannot be expected to operate the system properly. System resiliency: Parts of the cyber-physical system break; systemâ€™s ability to recover lost functionality remains intact. Environment: Serious externalities (threat to life as well as property, widespread environmental damage, measurable public health risks, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial: Socio-technical system (elections, financial grid, etc.) of which the affected component is a part is actively destabilized and enters unsafe state. Psychological: N/A. |
        | Catastrophic | Any one or more of these conditions hold. Physical harm: Multiple immediate fatalities (Emergency response probably cannot save the victims.) Operator resiliency: Operator incapacitated (includes fatality or otherwise incapacitated). System resiliency: Total loss of whole cyber-physical system, of which the software is a part. Environment: Extreme externalities (immediate public health threat, environmental damage leading to small ecosystem collapse, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial: Social systems (elections, financial grid, etc.) supported by the software collapse. Psychological: N/A. |
