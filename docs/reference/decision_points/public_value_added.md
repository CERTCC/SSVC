# Public Value Added

{% include-markdown "../../_generated/decision_points/public_value_added.md" %}

The intent of the definition is that one rarely if ever transitions from _limited_ to _ampliative_ or _ampliative_ to _precedence_.
A vulnerability could transition from _precedence_ to _ampliative_ and _ampliative_ to _limited_.
That is, *Public Value Added* should only be downgraded through future iterations or re-evaluations.
This directionality is because once other organizations make something public, they cannot effectively un-publish it
(it'll be recorded and people will know about it, even if they take down a webpage).
The rare case where *Public Value Added* increases would be if an organization published viable information, but 
then published additional misleading or obscuring information at a later time.
Then one might go from *limited* to *ampliative* in the interest of pointing to the better information.
