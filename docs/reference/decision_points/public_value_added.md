!!! note "Public Value Added"

    This decision point asks how much value a publication from the coordinator would benefit the broader community.
    The value is based on the state of existing public information about the vulnerablity.

    | Value | Description |
    | :---: | :--- |
    | Precedence | The publication would be the first publicly available, or be coincident with the first publicly available. |
    | Ampliative | Amplifies and/or augments the existing public information about the vulnerability, for example, adds additional detail, addresses or corrects errors in other public information, draws further attention to the vulnerability, etc. |
    | Limited | Minimal value added to the existing public information because existing information is already high quality and in multiple outlets. |


The intent of the definition is that one rarely if ever transitions from limited to ampliative or ampliative to precedence.
A vulnerability could transition from precedence to ampliative and ampliative to limited.
That is, [*Public Value Added*](#public-value-added) should only be downgraded through future iterations or re-evaluations.
This directionality is because once other organizations make something public, they cannot effectively un-publish it (it'll be recorded and people will know about it, even if they take down a webpage).
The rare case where [*Public Value Added*](#public-value-added) increases would be if an organization published viable information, but then published additional misleading or obscuring information at a later time.
Then one might go from [*limited*](#public-value-added) to [*ampliative*](#public-alue-added) in the interest of pointing to the better information.
