# Public Value Added

{% include-markdown "../../_generated/decision_points/public_value_added.md" %}

The intent of the definition is that one rarely if ever transitions from limited to ampliative or ampliative to precedence.
A vulnerability could transition from precedence to ampliative and ampliative to limited.
That is, [*Public Value Added*](#public-value-added) should only be downgraded through future iterations or re-evaluations.
This directionality is because once other organizations make something public, they cannot effectively un-publish it (it'll be recorded and people will know about it, even if they take down a webpage).
The rare case where [*Public Value Added*](#public-value-added) increases would be if an organization published viable information, but then published additional misleading or obscuring information at a later time.
Then one might go from [*limited*](#public-value-added) to [*ampliative*](#public-alue-added) in the interest of pointing to the better information.
