# National Cybersecurity Incident Scoring System (NCISS) Decision Points

The [National Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/cisa_national_cyber_incident_scoring_system_s508c.pdf)
was developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

Although the NCISS is implemented as a numerical scoring system, a number of
its criteria are amenable to modeling using SSVC decision points. We have
included a few examples here.
