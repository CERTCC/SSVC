    - [Safety Impact](./safety_impact.md)

This is a compound decision point, therefore it is a notational convenience.

Suppliers necessarily have a rather coarse-grained perspective on the broadly defined [Safety Impact](../safety_impact.md) Decision Point.
Therefore we simplify the above into a binary categorization:

- _Significant_ is when any impact meets the criteria for an impact of Major, Hazardous, or Catastrophic in the
  [Safety Impact](../safety_impact.md) table.
- _Minimal_ is when none do.
