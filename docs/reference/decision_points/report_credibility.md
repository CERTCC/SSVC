    Guidance on assessing credibility is available in [Credibility Indicators](../../topics/credibility_indicators.md).

An analyst should start with a presumption of credibility and proceed toward disqualification.
The reason for this is that, as a coordinator, occasionally doing a bit of extra work on a bad report is preferable to rejecting legitimate reports.
This is essentially stating a preference for false positives over false negatives with respect to credibility determination.

There are no ironclad rules for this assessment, and other coordinators may find other guidance works for them.
Credibility assessment topics include indicators for and against credibility, perspective, topic, and relationship to report scope.
