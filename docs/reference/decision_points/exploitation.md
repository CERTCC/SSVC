!!! tip "Gathering Information about Exploitation"

      See this [HowTo](../../howto/gathering_info/exploitation.md) for advice on gathering information about the Exploitation decision point.

The intent of this measure is the present state of exploitation of the vulnerability. The intent is not to predict future exploitation but only to acknowledge the current state of affairs. Predictive systems, such as EPSS, could be used to augment this decision or to notify stakeholders of likely changes [@jacobs2021epss].

## CWE-IDs for *PoC*

The table below lists CWE-IDs that could be used to mark a vulnerability as *PoC* if the vulnerability is described by the CWE-ID.

!!! example "CWE-295"

    For example, [CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation
    ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html), and its child CWEs,
    describe improper validation of TLS certificates. These CWE-IDs could
    always be marked as *PoC* since that meets condition (3) in the definition.

## Prior Versions

```python exec="true" idprefix=""
from ssvc.decision_points.ssvc.exploitation import VERSIONS
from ssvc.doc_helpers import prior_version, example_block

versions = VERSIONS[:-1]
for version in versions:
    print(example_block(version))
    print("\n---\n")
```
