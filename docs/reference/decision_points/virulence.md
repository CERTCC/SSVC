# Virulence

!!! warning "Superseded by Automatability"

    Virulence is superseded by the concept of automatability. 
    See [Automatable](./automatable.md) for more information.

!!! tip "See also"

    Virulence combines with [Value Density](./value_density.md) to inform 
    [Utility v1.0.0](./utility.md).

!!! example 

    Reasons a step may not be reliably automatable include: 

    - the vulnerable component is not searchable or enumerable on the network
    - weaponization may require human direction for each target
    - delivery may require channels that widely deployed network security 
    configurations block 
    - exploitation may be frustrated by adequate exploit-prevention
    techniques enabled by default. ASLR is an example of an 
    exploit-prevention tool
