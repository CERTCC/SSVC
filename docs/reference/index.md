# SSVC Reference

!!! tip inline end "Prerequisites"

    This section assumes that you are already familiar with SSVC and want to look up specific details.
    
    If you are new to SSVC, you may want to start with the [Learning SSVC](../tutorials/index.md) section.
    If you are already familiar with SSVC and want to learn more, you may want to start with either the
    [Understanding SSVC](../topics/index.md) or [SSVC How To](../howto/index.md) sections.

In this section, we provide reference documentation for SSVC.
We have organized the reference documentation into two main sections:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

     A list of all the decision points, values, and versions.

- :material-language-python: [**Code Documentation**](code/index.md)

     Documentation for the SSVC Python modules.
