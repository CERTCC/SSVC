# Decision Point Groups

Decision Point groups provide collections of related Decision Points for some
specific purpose.

With the introduction of [Decision Tables](decision_tables.md), 
Decision Point groups are less important than they once were, and may be
deprecated in a future release.
However, they can still be useful for documentation and
for some programmatic uses.
