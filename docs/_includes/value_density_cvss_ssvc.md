!!! tip "CVSS:Value Density vs SSVC:Value Density"

    The [CVSS Value Density](../reference/decision_points/cvss/value_density.md)
    vector element was developed alongside the identically named
    [Value Density](../reference/decision_points/value_density.md) decision 
    point in SSVC. We intend for these two decision points to be interchangeable.
    The main difference is that the CVSS Value Density accomodates an explicit
    _Not Defined_ value, whereas the SSVC Value Density does not.
