!!! tip "Default Safety Values"

    If the decision maker knows nothing about the environment in which the device is used, we suggest assuming a
    [*marginal*](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md) [*Safety Impact*](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md).
    This position is conservative, but software is thoroughly embedded in daily life now, so we suggest that the decision
    maker provide evidence that no one's well-being will suffer.
