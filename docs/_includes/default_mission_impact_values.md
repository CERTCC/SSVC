!!! tip "Default Mission Impact Values"

    Similarly, with [*Mission Impact*](/reference/decision_points/mission_impact.md), the deployer should assume that the software is in use at the
    organization for a reason, and that it supports essential functions unless they have evidence otherwise.
    With a total lack of information, assume [*support crippled*](/reference/decision_points/mission_impact.md) as a default.
