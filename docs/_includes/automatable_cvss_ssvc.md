!!! tip "CVSS:Automatable vs SSVC:Automatable"

    The [CVSS Automatable](../reference/decision_points/cvss/automatable.md) vector element is derived from
    the identically named
    [Automatable](../reference/decision_points/automatable.md) decision point in SSVC. We intend for these two decision
    points to be interchangeable.
    The main difference is that the CVSS Automatable accomodates an explicit
    _Not Defined_ value, whereas the SSVC Automatable does not.
