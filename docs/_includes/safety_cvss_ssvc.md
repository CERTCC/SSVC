!!! tip "CVSS:Safety vs SSVC:Public Safety Impact vs SSVC:Safety Impact"

    The [CVSS Safety](../reference/decision_points/cvss/safety.md) vector element
    is semantically interchangeable with the
    [SSVC Public Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/public_safety_impact.md)
    decision point.
    The main difference is that the [CVSS Safety](../reference/decision_points/cvss/safety.md)
    vector element accomodates an explicit _Not Defined_ value, whereas the
    [SSVC Public Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/public_safety_impact.md)
    does not.

    The [SSVC Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/safety_impact.md) decision point provides a higher-resolution view of the safety impact.
    The [SSVC Public Safety Impact](../reference/decision_points/public_safety_impact.md) and
    [CVSS Safety](../reference/decision_points/cvss/safety.md) decision points are
    lower-resolution views of the safety impact.
