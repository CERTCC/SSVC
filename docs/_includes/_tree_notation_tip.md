!!! tip "Tree Notation"

    Rectangles are decision points, and triangles represent outcomes. 
    The values for each decision point are different, as described above.
    Outcomes are priority decisions (defer, scheduled, out-of-cycle, immediate).
    Outcome triangles are color coded:

    - Defer = gray with green outline
    - Scheduled = yellow
    - Out-of-Cycle = orange
    - Immediate = red with black outline
