!!! question inline end "What about CVSS v4?"

    Since this documentation was written, CVSS v4 has been released.
    While we plan to address CVSS v4 in a future update to the SSVC documentation, we are 
    retaining our CVSS v3.1 content because it remains the most widely used version of CVSS.
