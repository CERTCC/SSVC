!!! tip "Default System Exposure Values"

    If the deployer does not know their exposure,<!--lowercase exposure on purpose, this is the general concept--> that
    means they do not know where the devices are or how they are controlled, so they should assume
    [*System Exposure*](../reference/decision_points/system_exposure.md) is [*open*](../reference/decision_points/system_exposure.md).
