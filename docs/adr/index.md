# SSVC Decision Records

We have adopted the use of [Markdown Any Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 
to document significant decisions made in the development of SSVC. Below is a list of all
the decision records that have been made.

!!! warning "See repository for authoritative source of decision records"

    While we include these records in the site for reference, the authoritative source
    for these records, including their current adoption status, is the
    [SSVC GitHub repository](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC/tree/main/docs/adr).
