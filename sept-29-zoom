Discussion and review of ISO and (some) DoD guidance to include or exclude names for the two roles currently identified as “Patch Applier” and “Patch Developer”. 

Supply Chain 
Depending on their position in the supply chain, many vendors can describe themselves as both a patch developer and applier.  A vendor could be unable to determine if their product is vulnerable without knowing the determination another vendor has made.  Multiple levels can be involved. (For example, a laptop vendor is waiting on a response from operating system vendor. Meanwhile this operating system vendor is waiting on a reply from their primary hard drive vendor.  The hard drive vendor is busy testing their drives for the vulnerability.  Everyone is waiting for a response before they can make a determination on their vulnerability status and necessary actions.) 

The general patch applier/developer discussion included; vendor, system owner, mitigator, supplier, consumer, etc. Discussion notes are included. The consensus is replace “patch applier” with remediator, and replace “patch developer” with supplier.
