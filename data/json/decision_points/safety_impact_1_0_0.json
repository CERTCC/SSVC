System resiliency: Small reduction in built-in system safety margins; OR small reduction in system functional capabilities that support safe operation.

Operator resiliency: Requires action by system operator to maintain safe system state as a result of exploitation of the vulnerability where operator actions would be within their capabilities but the actions require their full attention and effort; OR significant distraction or discomfort to operators; OR causes significant occupational safety hazard. System resiliency: System safety margin effectively eliminated but no actual harm; OR failure of system functional capabilities that support safe operation. Environment: Major externalities (property damage, environmental damage, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial: Financial losses that likely lead to bankruptcy of multiple persons.

Operator resiliency: Actions that would keep the system in a safe state are beyond system operator capabilities, resulting in adverse conditions; OR great physical distress to system operators such that they cannot be expected to operate the system properly. System resiliency: Parts of the cyber-physical system break; system’s ability to recover lost functionality remains intact. Environment: Serious externalities (threat to life as well as property, widespread environmental damage, measurable public health risks, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial: Socio-technical system (elections, financial grid, etc.) of which the affected component is a part is actively destabilized and enters unsafe state. Psychological: N/A."

Environment: Extreme externalities (immediate public health threat, environmental damage leading to small ecosystem collapse, etc.) imposed on other parties. Financial: Social systems (elections, financial grid, etc.) supported by the software collapse. Psychological: N/A."
