# SSVC JSON Schemas v2 Readme

## Why are there soft links here?

We are now automatically generating the schema files for SSVC based on their
corresponding Pydantic models. This allows us to keep the schema files in sync
with the code more easily. However, it required us to make some changes to the 
file names. So we've left behind some soft links from the original file names 
to help ease the transition.
